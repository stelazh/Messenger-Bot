# Messenger-Bot

This application is a Facebook messenger bot built with C# using Microsoft's Bot Framework. 
It also allows for natural language interpertation to give results back to users and is programmed to hold a conversation with 
someone as if it was me. It is currently unfinished because the bot frmework had a bug at the time of development.
